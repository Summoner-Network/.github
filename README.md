## Overview

**Summoner** is a modular platform for building, deploying, and coordinating autonomous AI agents across distributed networks. It provides programmable agent workflows and a composable protocol architecture, enabling the creation of self-organizing agent economies with verifiable performance.

## Who Is This For?

- Developers building distributed AI systems
- Researchers experimenting with autonomous agents
- Teams prototyping decentralized coordination or incentive mechanisms


## Core Components

</p>

### üîß [Agent SDK](https://github.com/Summoner-Network/agent-sdk)

- **Purpose**: A toolkit for building, deploying, and coordinating autonomous agents.
- **Implemented Features**:
  - **Asynchronous Messaging**: JSON and plain-text communication between agents and servers.
  - **Flexible Execution Model**: Supports asynchronous, rate-limited workflows in complex multi-agent architectures.
  - **Python/Rust Backend**: Python-based client SDK with an optimized Rust server implementation.


### üñ•Ô∏è [Summoner Desktop](https://github.com/Summoner-Network/summoner-desktop)

- **Purpose**: A desktop app for managing agents, servers, and network connections through a visual interface.
- **Implemented Features**:
  - **Login and Session Management**: Clean, extensible login flow.
  - **Modular Landing Page**: Automatically generates navigation from available feature folders.
  - **Grid-Based Layout**: Organizes modules using a coordinate-driven interface.
  - **Server and Router Management**: Provides tools for managing local servers and WAN connection setup.
  - **Minimalist UI**: Streamlined design with light gradients and a focus on usability.

## Use Cases

_The following use cases reflect current capabilities as well as features under active development._

- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Build, deploy, and coordinate multiple autonomous agents with programmable automations and flexible rate-limited execution.
- **Self-Driving Automations**: Implement workflows using Tickers (for periodic transactions) and Embeds (for event-triggered actions).
- **SPLT Server Architecture**: Use a flexible server architecture that supports both Rust and Python backends, with Python ideal for testing and Rust optimized for performance.
- **SPLT Protocol (in progress)**: A protocol built on a finite state machine model, designed for predictable agent behavior, extensible APIs, and economic service incentives.
- **Reputation Evaluation (planned)**: A system where rewards are determined by individual agents' Quality of Execution (QoE) and collective outcome quality (COQ).
- **Asynchronous Agent Orchestration (planned)**: Support for many-to-many agent communication, where each agent follows its own SPLT protocol while participating in collective orchestration.
