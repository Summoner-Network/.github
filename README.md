## Overview

**Summoner** is a modular platform for building, deploying, and coordinating autonomous AI agents across distributed networks. It provides programmable agent workflows and a composable protocol architecture, enabling the creation of self-organizing agent economies with verifiable performance.

## Who Is This For?

- Developers building distributed AI systems
- Researchers experimenting with autonomous agents
- Teams prototyping decentralized coordination or incentive mechanisms


## Core Components

</p>

### üîß [Agent SDK](https://github.com/Summoner-Network/agent-sdk)

- **Purpose**: A toolkit for building, deploying, and coordinating autonomous agents.
- **Implemented Features**:
  - **Asynchronous Messaging**: JSON and plain-text communication between agents and servers.
  - **Flexible Execution Model**: Supports asynchronous, rate-limited workflows in complex multi-agent architectures.
  - **Python/Rust Backend**: Python-based client SDK with an optimized Rust server implementation.


### üñ•Ô∏è [Summoner Desktop](https://github.com/Summoner-Network/summoner-desktop)

- **Purpose**: A desktop app for managing agents, servers, and network connections through a visual interface.
- **Implemented Features**:
  - **Login and Session Management**: Clean, extensible login flow.
  - **Modular Landing Page**: Automatically generates navigation from available feature folders.
  - **Grid-Based Layout**: Organizes modules using a coordinate-driven interface.
  - **Server and Router Management**: Provides tools for managing local servers and WAN connection setup.
  - **Minimalist UI**: Streamlined design with light gradients and a focus on usability.

## Use Cases


| Use Case                             | Description                                                                                                                                             | Status          |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Multi-Agent Coordination**         | Build, deploy, and coordinate multiple autonomous agents with programmable automations and flexible rate-limited execution.                           | ‚úÖ Implemented   |
| **SPLT Server Architecture**         | Flexible server framework supporting both Rust and Python backends. Python is ideal for testing; Rust is optimized for performance.                    | ‚úÖ Implemented   |
| **Self-Driving Automations**         | Use Tickers for periodic tasks and Embeds for event-triggered actions to create automated workflows.                                                    | üõ†Ô∏è In Progress  |
| **SPLT Protocol**                    | Finite state machine-based protocol for predictable agent behavior, extensible APIs, and future economic incentives.                                   | üõ†Ô∏è In Progress  |
| **Asynchronous Agent Orchestration** | Many-to-many agent coordination via both individual and group-level SPLT protocols.                                                                    | üõ†Ô∏è In Progress  |
| **Reputation Evaluation**            | Scoring model combining individual agents' Quality of Execution (QoE) with the group's Collective Outcome Quality (COQ).                               | üõ†Ô∏è In Progress   |
